# EcoSIM Plant Trait Sanity Rules

These checks are intentionally conservative. They catch values that are likely to break EcoSIM preprocessing, violate obvious unit/range expectations, or reveal a malformed block. They do not prove that a parameter is ecologically optimal for a given species.

Use web-informed evidence after these deterministic checks when judging whether a plausible numeric value is ecologically reasonable for the plant represented by the block.

## Block Scope

- One `PLANT traits for FUNCTIONAL TYPE` block is one plant record.
- The default scope is the first grid: `NY=1, NX=1`.
- Check all plant records at that grid, usually distinguished by `NZ` and PFT code.
- Do not infer that repeated blocks for other `NX` or `NY` values have been validated unless explicitly checked.

## Structural Checks

Required sections:

- `PLANT CLASS INFORMATION`
- `PHOTOSYNTHETIC PROPERTIES`
- `OPTICAL PROPERTIES`
- `PHENOLOGICAL PROPERTIES`
- `MORPHOLOGICAL PROPERTIES`
- `ROOT CHARACTERISTICS`
- `ROOT UPTAKE PARAMETERS`
- `WATER RELATIONS`
- `ORGAN GROWTH YIELDS`
- `ORGAN N AND P CONCENTRATIONS`

The parser should keep duplicate variable names in file order.

## High-Value Range Rules

- In `PLANT CLASS INFORMATION`, any block with `ISTYP` set to annual should have `IWTYP` set to evergreen. This is an EcoSIM convention: all annual plants are considered evergreen for the phenology-type field.
- `IEBTYP` should use EcoSIM embryophyte type codes `0=bryophyte`, `1=pteridophyte`, `2=gymnosperm`, `3=monocot`, and `4=eudicot`. The checker accepts either a valid integer code or a recognized label in `.desc` output, errors on missing, unrecognized, non-integer, or out-of-range values, and warns when the value conflicts with the inferred PFT form from the block code/name.
- `ISNTYP` should use EcoSIM snow interception pattern codes `0=bryophyte`, `1=grass`, `2=shrub`, `3=deciduous tree`, and `4=conifer`. The checker errors on missing, non-integer, or out-of-range numeric codes, and warns when the code conflicts with the label text or the inferred PFT form from the block code/name.
- Fraction traits such as `RUBP`, `PEPC`, `CHL`, `FCO2`, `ALBR`, `ALBP`, `TAUR`, `TAUP`, `CFI`, `PORT`, `PhiMIN`, `PhiMAX`, and `PhiMean` should be within `[0, 1]`. In photosynthetic properties, `CHL` is the fraction of total leaf protein in chlorophyll-bound/light-harvesting proteins, including chlorophyll-protein complexes associated with PSI, PSII, and LHC.
- `CHL` values in `PHOTOSYNTHETIC PROPERTIES` should normally fall in a broad screening range of `0.08-0.30` on the total-leaf-protein basis. Values below this range likely under-allocate protein to light harvesting, especially for evergreen needleleaf PFTs.
- Do not impose a universal deterministic range on `SLA1`. Allow a web-informed warning when a species- or site-specific range has been converted to `m2 gC-1` with a documented dry-mass carbon fraction. Do not use `SLA1` to derive leaf-area photosynthetic capacities unless the model mapping and conversions are explicitly supported.
- `CLASS` must contain four numeric inclination fractions, each in `[0, 1]`, summing to one.
- Optical checks should flag `ALBR + TAUR > 1` and `ALBP + TAUP > 1`.
- `ANGSH` must be `0 degrees` for plant forms that lack petiole or sheath tissue. This includes conifer, lichen, and moss PFTs where a nonzero petiole/sheath angle would imply an organ that is not represented by the plant morphology.
- Growth yields `DMLF`, `DMSHE`, `DMSTK`, `DMRSV`, `DMHSK`, `DMEAR`, `DMGR`, and `DMRT` should be positive and normally not exceed about `1.2`.
- Phenological accumulation thresholds `VRNLI` and `VRNXI` should be nonnegative; zero can encode no accumulated leafout or leafoff requirement.
- Organ N and P mass ratios (`CNLF`, `CNSHE`, `CNSTK`, `CNRSV`, `CNHSK`, `CNEAR`, `CNGR`, `CNRT`, `CPLF`, `CPSHE`, `CPSTK`, `CPRSV`, `CPHSK`, `CPEAR`, `CPGR`, `CPRT`) must be positive; values above `0.2 g element gC-1` are suspicious enough to warn.
- `OSMO` should be negative in MPa. Very negative values below about `-5 MPa` deserve a warning.
- `WTSTDI` should be nonnegative. It is standing dead biomass at initialization, so judge it against the simulation start date, cohort origin, and disturbance history rather than as a timeless species trait. A seed-origin run should normally start with zero PFT-specific standing dead biomass unless legacy material is intentionally represented.
- `KLGMAX` is retired and is not required for woody or non-woody PFT blocks. Do not flag its absence or use it to judge coarse-root lignification.

## Root Conduit Hydraulics

- Root-resistance behavior is code-version dependent. Verify these equations in the EcoSIM source revision that produced the run and record the commit or version when possible. If it cannot be verified, label resistance decomposition and scaling conclusions as version-unverified. Do not assume that parameter metadata or equations from another branch describe the active executable.
- Interpret `RSRR` as radial root resistivity per unit absorbing-root surface area in `MPa h m-1`. In the regular EcoSIM uptake calculation, `RootRadialResist = RSRR*(VLMicP/VLWatMicPM)/RootSurfaceArea`; therefore high `RSRR` means low water uptake capacity, and drying micropores increase the effective radial resistance further.
- Convert `RSRR` to the fully wetted intrinsic radial conductivity with `k_radial = 1/RSRR` in `m h-1 MPa-1`, or `k_radial = 1/(3600*RSRR)` in `m s-1 MPa-1`. Do not interpret conductivity-like NetCDF metadata as overriding the resistance semantics established by the model equation.
- For conifers, use `1000-10000 MPa h m-1` as a broad deterministic warning screen. This corresponds to `2.78e-8-2.78e-7 m s-1 MPa-1`. Field means for intact fine roots of four mature conifers were `0.51e-7-2.06e-7 m s-1 MPa-1` (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rhisph.2022.100489). The screen is deliberately wider because intact-root measurements can include axial and interface resistance and are not identical to EcoSIM's intrinsic radial term.
- For non-conifers without species-level evidence, warn only when implied `k_radial` is outside the broad cross-study root hydraulic-conductivity envelope of `4.7e-9-1.2e-5 m s-1 MPa-1` (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10999368/). Prefer species-, organ-, age-, temperature-, and measurement-specific evidence whenever available.
- Never tune `RSRR` to compensate for implausible `RVSR` or `ARSRA`. Evaluate radial, axial, and soil resistance separately. If `RSRR` is high, inspect their modeled contributions during moist periods and use a sensitivity test before changing the trait.
- Interpret `RVSR` as the literal arithmetic mean root-conduit lumen radius in meters. Use tracheid lumen radius for conifers and vessel-element lumen radius for angiosperms. Never substitute an effective hydraulic radius.
- Convert measured diameter to `RVSR` with `RVSR = mean_lumen_diameter_m / 2`. Prefer species-level root measurements; do not silently substitute stem or hydraulically weighted diameters.
- Screen conifer `RVSR` at `2.5e-6-40e-6 m` radius, corresponding to the broad published `5-80 um` tracheid-diameter envelope (https://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/pubs/chap/chap_2015_domec_001.pdf). Treat this as a warning range and use species-specific web evidence to narrow it. Mature healthy ponderosa-pine roots measured near Burns, Oregon averaged `30.4 um` tracheid diameter, or about `15.2e-6 m` radius (https://doi.org/10.1093/treephys/18.5.333).
- In the inspected EcoSIM implementation, single-conduit resistance is `ARSRA * Rax_ref * (1e-6/RVSR)^4`, single-conduit area is `pi*RVSR^2`, and conduit count is `0.2*(RRAD2M/RVSR)^2`. Require the implied count to be at least one only after confirming that geometry in the active code version. With `RRAD2M` and `ARSRA` fixed, this implementation makes bundle axial resistance scale as `RVSR^-2`; do not generalize that scaling to another code revision without verification.
- Require `ARSRA > 0` and warn when `ARSRA < 1`, because pit, end-wall, and nonideal-flow effects cannot make an actual conduit less resistant than its ideal lumen. Use `ARSRA`, not an artificially small `RVSR`, to represent those additional axial resistances.

## Active Structural Protein Pools

- Relate total protein C to both total N and total P in active structural biomass. For an organ with structural N and P concentrations `N/C` and `P/C`, calculate the N-supported protein fraction as `(protein C:N) * (N/C)`, the P-supported fraction as `(protein C:P) * (P/C)`, and the realized protein C fraction as the smaller of the two.
- For leaves, all structural biomass is active. Use `leaf protein C / leaf structural C = min(CNWL*CNLF, CPWL*CPLF)`.
- For non-tree roots, all structural biomass is active. Use `root protein C / root structural C = min(CNWR*CNRT, CPWR*CPRT)` across the entire structural root pool.
- For tree and other woody-PFT roots, apply the same root relationship only to active structural biomass and exclude lignified heartwood. Separate `CNRTLIG` and `CPRTLIG` inputs are no longer required. A static trait file does not contain the dynamic active-to-heartwood C partition, so do not extrapolate the active-root protein fraction to the whole woody-root pool.
- Require the N/P-limited protein C fraction to be no greater than `1 gC protein gC structural biomass-1`. Warn when either single-nutrient-supported amount exceeds one even if the other nutrient keeps the realized pool below one.
- Interpret `CNWL`, `CPWL`, `CNWR`, and `CPWR` as protein-pool stoichiometry, not whole-organ elemental C:N or C:P ratios.

## Clean Photosynthetic Parameterization

Apply these as pathway-aware physiological warnings. Promote them to errors when `--strict-physiology` is requested, except for the model-formulation-sensitive `Jmax:Vcmax` diagnostic. The ranges are deliberately broad screening bounds, not cultivar-specific calibration targets.

- Require a recognizable `ICTYP` pathway and all inputs needed for the corresponding kinetic, allocation, capacity-ratio, and optical checks. Missing values must not silently disable strict physiology.
- Treat `VCMX`, `VOMX`, `XKCO2`, and `XKO2` as a Rubisco kinetic quartet. Check `VCMX/VOMX` against `6-14` for C4 and `2-8` for C3, and check implied specificity `VCMX*XKO2/(VOMX*XKCO2)` against `70-140`. This prevents an unrealistic turnover ratio from being hidden by compensating Km values.
- Screen C4 `XKCO2` at `10-35 uM`, `XKO2` at `120-400 uM`, and effective `XKCO24` at `0.5-20 uM`. Screen C3 `XKCO2` at `8-30 uM` and `XKO2` at `180-650 uM`. EcoSIM uses these as aqueous 25 C reference constants.
- Define photosynthesis-related allocations (`RUBP`, `PEPC`, and `CHL`) relative to total leaf protein C, not leaf structural C or total leaf N. First derive `leaf_protein_C_per_leaf_C = min(CNWL*CNLF, CPWL*CPLF)` and `effective_CNWL = leaf_protein_C_per_leaf_C/CNLF`. Then estimate enzyme nitrogen allocation with `fN_enzyme = allocation * effective_CNWL / 3.3`, using `3.3 gC protein gN-1` when enzyme-specific composition is unavailable. Screen Rubisco at `5-16%` of total leaf N for C4 and `8-30%` for C3. Screen C4 PEPC at `1-6%`; field maize commonly allocates about `2.5-3.5%`.
- Require `RUBP + CHL + PEPC <= 0.65` for C4 and `RUBP + CHL <= 0.65` for C3 because these fractions draw from one total-leaf-protein pool.
- For C4, calculate protein-normalized `Vpmax:Vcmax = VCMX4*PEPC/(VCMX*RUBP)` and screen at `0.8-2.5`.
- Calculate protein-normalized `Jmax:Vcmax` using EcoSIM's chlorophyll-C conversion: `ETMX*CHL*fCHLMESO/(3.7*VCMX*RUBP)` for C4, screened at `4-8`; and `ETMX*CHL/(3.5*VCMX*RUBP)` for C3, screened at `1.2-3`. Treat this as a lower-priority, model-formulation-sensitive diagnostic that remains `WARN` in strict mode. Do not use it to override direct protein-allocation evidence for `CHL` or `RUBP`, and do not force agreement with ratios derived under a different photosynthesis formulation.
- Screen `FCO2` at `0.25-0.50` for C4 and `0.55-0.85` for C3. Screen C4 `fCHLMESO` at `0.40-0.75`.
- Screen leaf PAR absorptance `1-ALBP-TAUP` at `0.80-0.95` and broad shortwave absorptance `1-ALBR-TAUR` at `0.30-0.85`.

Use web evidence to narrow these ranges for a species, cultivar, nitrogen treatment, growth stage, and measurement protocol. Useful foundations include the corrected Rubisco kinetic compilation (https://doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erab383), maize nitrogen allocation (https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2016.00699), maize seasonal capacity ratios (https://doi.org/10.1111/pce.13511), and maize mesophyll/bundle-sheath chlorophyll partitioning (https://doi.org/10.1104/pp.51.6.1133).

## Woody Versus Herbaceous Root Blocks

Woody short codes include common EcoSIM trees and shrubs such as `ndlf`, `ndld`, `bdlf`, `bdln`, `bdlw`, `bspr`, `dfir`, `jpin`, `lpin`, `tasp`, `woak`, `shru`, `bush`, and `busn`.

Woody blocks should include:

- `ROOTMAGE`
- `PhiMIN`
- `PhiMAX`
- `R95MAT`

Herbaceous blocks should include `PhiMean` unless both `PhiMIN` and `PhiMAX`
are defined. When the root maturation pair `PhiMIN`/`PhiMAX` is present,
`PhiMean` is not required.
Exception: soybean (`soyb*`) is a eudicot crop that can express secondary root
growth, so `ROOTMAGE`, `PhiMIN`, `PhiMAX`, and `R95MAT` are allowed for soybean
without issuing the generic non-woody root-trait warning. Still check their
numeric bounds and `PhiMIN <= PhiMAX`.

## Interpretation

Treat `ERROR` findings as likely malformed or numerically invalid input. Treat `WARN` findings as requiring domain review. A warning can be ecologically defensible, but it should be traceable to a species-specific source, deliberate parameterization, or documented EcoSIM convention.
