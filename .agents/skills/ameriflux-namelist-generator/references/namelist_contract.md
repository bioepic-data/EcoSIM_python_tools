# AmeriFlux EcoSIM Namelist Contract

This reference captures the namelist pattern derived from:

`/Users/jinyuntang/work/github/ecosim_workspace/croots/examples/run_dir/blodgett/Blodget.ndlf.nolig.namelist`

## Required Blocks

- `&regression_test`: keep `cells = 3` unless a regression workflow asks otherwise.
- `&ecosim`: core model controls, forcing input files, solver cycles, and history output variables.
- `&bbgcforc`: keep present even when empty.
- `&ecosim_time`: restart, timestep, stop, and diagnostic controls.

## Site-Specific Fields

- `case_name`: concise site or experiment label.
- `pft_file_in`: EcoSIM PFT parameter NetCDF. Use the croots `input_data/ecosim_pftpar_20260520.nc` default only when it matches the experiment.
- `grid_file_in`: site grid NetCDF, usually `<SITE_ID>_ecosim_grid.nc`.
- `pft_mgmt_in`: plant management NetCDF, usually `<SITE_ID>_pft_mgmt.nc`.
- `clm_hour_file_in`: hourly climate forcing NetCDF, usually `<SITE_ID>_ecosim_climate.nc`.
- `atm_ghg_in`: greenhouse-gas concentration file.
- `soil_mgmt_in` and `clm_factor_in`: normally `'NO'` for AmeriFlux natural-site runs unless a site-specific file exists.

## Chronology

The Blodgett example uses:

```text
start_date = '19410101000000'
forc_periods = 2012,2015,18,2012,2022,1,2012,2022,0
stop_n = 82
stop_option = 'nyears'
```

Interpretation:

- `forc_periods` is nine integers: spinup forcing start/end/cycles, regular forcing start/end/cycles, and final forcing start/end/cycles.
- A zero cycle in the final triple can encode no additional final period.
- `stop_n` overrides the run length implied by `forc_periods`.
- `start_date` is the model simulation date, not necessarily the first climate forcing year.

For AmeriFlux site generation, use the climate NetCDF year range as the default forcing window. If `netCDF4` or a `year` variable is unavailable, infer the forcing range from AmeriFlux ERA5 filenames under `data/` or `result/`. Still choose `start_date` and `stop_n` deliberately for the scientific question.

## Path Conventions

- If the namelist lives in an EcoSIM run directory, write input paths relative to that directory.
- If the namelist lives under `result/<SITE_ID>/`, absolute paths are safer unless the user requests relative paths.
- Verify paths from the directory where EcoSIM will be launched, not from the Python-tools repository.

## Default Output Variables

The generator defaults to the Blodgett root-carbon diagnostics, including canopy C fluxes, root biomass and sink weights, soil temperature/water variables, plant physiological variables, microbial pore-flow variables, and root hydraulic state variables.

Trim `hist_fincl1` for long production runs if output volume is too high.

## Validation Checklist

- Every quoted file path either exists or is intentionally `'NO'`.
- `delta_time` is `3600.` for hourly forcing.
- `hist_nhtfrq=-24` for daily history output unless a different output cadence is requested.
- `hist_mfilt` is large enough for the number of output records per file.
- `NPXS`, `NPYS`, `NCYC_LITR`, and `NCYC_SNOW` match the numerical stability needs of the site hydrology and redox chemistry.
